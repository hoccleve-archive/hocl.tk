                <l>Musynge upon the restlees bysynesse</l>
                <l>Which that this troubly world hath ay on honde,</l>
                <l>That othir thyng than fruyt of bittirnesse</l>
                <l>Ne yildith naght, as I can undirstonde,</l>
                <l>At Chestres In, right faste by the Stronde,</l>
                <l>As I lay in my bed upon a nyght,</l>
                <l>Thoght me byrefte of sleep the force and might. </l>
                <l>And many a day and nyght that wikkid hyne</l>
                <l>Hadde beforn vexed my poore goost</l>
                <l>So grevously that of angwissh and pyne</l>
                <l>No rycher man was nowhere in no coost.</l>
                <l>This dar I seyn, may no wight make his boost</l>
                <l>That he with thoght was bet than I aqweynted,</l>
                <l>For to the deeth he wel ny hath me feynted.</l>
                <l>Bysyly in my mynde I gan revolve</l>
                <l>The welthe unseur of every creature,</l>
                <l>How lightly that Fortune it can dissolve</l>
                <l>Whan that hir list that it no lenger dure;</l>
                <l>And of the brotilnesse of hir nature</l>
                <l>My tremblynge herte so greet gastnesse hadde</l>
                <l>That my spirites were of my lyf sadde.</l>
                <l>Me fil to mynde how that nat longe agoo</l>
                <l>Fortunes strook doun thraste estat rial</l>
                <l>Into mescheef, and I took heede also</l>
                <l>Of many anothir lord that hadde a fal.</l>
                <l>In mene estat eek sikirnesse at al</l>
                <l>Ne saw I noon, but I sy atte laste</l>
                <l>Wher seuretee for to abyde hir caste.</l>
                <l>In poore estat shee pighte hir pavyloun</l>
                <l>To kevere hir fro the storm of descendynge</l>
                <l>For shee kneew no lower descencion</l>
                <l>Sauf oonly deeth, fro which no wight lyvynge</l>
                <l>Deffende him may; and thus in my musynge</l>
                <l>I destitut was of joie and good hope,</l>
                <l>And to myn ese nothyng cowde I grope.</l>
                <l>For right as blyve ran it in my thoght,</l>
                <l>Thogh poore I be, yit sumwhat leese I may.</l>
                <l>Than deemed I that seurtee wolde noght</l>
                <l>With me abyde; it is nat to hir pay</l>
                <l>Ther to sojourne as shee descende may.</l>
                <l>And thus unsikir of my smal lyflode,</l>
                <l>Thoght leide on me ful many an hevy lode.</l>
                <l>I thoghte eek, if I into povert creepe,</l>
                <l>Than am I entred into sikirnesse;</l>
                <l>But swich seurtee mighte I ay waille and weepe,</l>
                <l>For povert breedith naght but hevynesse.</l>
                <l>Allas, wher is this worldes stablenesse?</l>
                <l>Heer up, heer doun; heer honour, heer repreef;</l>
                <l>Now hool, now seek; now bountee, now mescheef.</l>
                <l>And whan I hadde rollid up and doun</l>
                <l>This worldes stormy wawes in my mynde,</l>
                <l>I sy wel povert was exclusioun</l>
                <l>Of al welfare regnynge in mankynde;</l>
                <l>And how in bookes thus writen I fynde,</l>
                <l>"The werste kynde of wrecchidnesse is</l>
                <l>A man to han be weleful or this."</l>
                <l>Allas, thoghte I, what sikirnesse is that</l>
                <l>To lyve ay seur of greef and of nusance?</l>
                <l>What shal I do? Best is I stryve nat</l>
                <l>Ageyn the peys of Fortunes balance,</l>
                <l>For wel I woot that hir brotil constance</l>
                <l>A wight no whyle souffre can sojourne</l>
                <l>In o plyt; thus nat wiste I how to tourne.</l>
                <l>For whan man weeneth stonde moost constant,</l>
                <l>Thanne is he nexte to his overthrowynge;</l>
                <l>So flittynge is shee and so variant,</l>
                <l>Ther is no trust upon hir fair lawhynge;</l>
                <l>Aftir glad look, shee shapith hir to stynge.</l>
                <l>I was adrad so of hir gerynesse</l>
                <l>That my lyf was but a deedly gladnesse.</l>
                <l>This ilke nyght I walwid to and fro</l>
                <l>Seekynge reste, but certeynly shee</l>
                <l>Appeerid nat, for thoght, my cruel fo,</l>
                <l>Chaced had hir and sleep away fro me.</l>
                <l>And for I sholde nat allone be,</l>
                <l>Ageyn my lust wach proferred his servyse,</l>
                <l>And I admittid him in hevy wyse.</l>
                <l>So long a nyght ne felte I nevere noon</l>
                <l>As was that same, to my jugement.</l>
                <l>Whoso that thoghty is, is wo begoon;</l>
                <l>The thoghtful wight is vessel of torment;</l>
                <l>Ther nis no greef to him equipollent.</l>
                <l>He graveth deepest of seeknesses alle:</l>
                <l>Ful wo is him that in swich thoght is falle.</l>
                <l>What wight that inly pensyf is, I trowe,</l>
                <l>His moost desir is to be solitarie.</l>
                <l>That this is sooth, in my persone I knowe,</l>
                <l>For evere whyl that fretynge adversarie</l>
                <l>Myn herte made to him tributarie</l>
                <l>In sowkynge of the fressheste of my blood;</l>
                <l>To sorwe soul me thoghte it dide me good.</l>
                <l>For the nature of hevynesse is this:</l>
                <l>If it habownde greetly in a wight,</l>
                <l>The place eschueth he whereas joie is,</l>
                <l>For joie and he nat mowe accorde aright.</l>
                <l>As discordant as day is unto nyght,</l>
                <l>And honour adversarie is unto shame,</l>
                <l>Is hevynesse so to joie and game.</l>
                <l>Whan to the thoghtful wight is told a tale,</l>
                <l>He heerith it as thogh he thennes were;</l>
                <l>His hevy thoghtes him so plukke and hale</l>
                <l>Hidir and thidir, and him greeve and dere,</l>
                <l>That his eres availle him nat a pere;</l>
                <l>He undirstandith nothyng what men seye,</l>
                <l>So been his wittes fer goon hem to pleye.</l>
                <l>The smert of thoght I by experience</l>
                <l>Knowe as wel as any man dooth lyvynge.</l>
                <l>His frosty swoot and fyry hoot fervence,</l>
                <l>And troubly dremes drempt al in wakynge,</l>
                <l>My mazid heed sleeplees han of konnynge</l>
                <l>And wit despoillid, and so me bejapid</l>
                <l>That aftir deeth ful often have I gapid.</l>
                <l>Passe over; whan this stormy nyght was goon</l>
                <l>And day gan at my wyndowe in to prye,</l>
                <l>I roos me up, for boote fond I noon</l>
                <l>In myn unresty bed lenger to lye.</l>
                <l>Into the feeld I dressid me in hye,</l>
                <l>And in my wo I herte-deep gan wade,</l>
                <l>As he that was bareyne of thoghtes glade.</l>
                <l>By that I walkid hadde a certeyn tyme,</l>
                <l>Were it an hour I not, or more or lesse,</l>
                <l>A poore old hoor man cam walkynge by me,</l>
                <l>And seide, "Good day, sire, and God yow blesse!"</l>
                <l>But I no word, for my seekly distresse</l>
                <l>Forbad myn eres usen hir office,</l>
                <l>For which this old man heeld me lewde and nyce,</l>
                <l>Til he took heede to my drery cheere,</l>
                <l>And to my deedly colour pale and wan.</l>
                <l>Than thoghte he thus: "This man that I see heere</l>
                <l>Al wrong is wrestid, by aght I see can."</l>
                <l>He stirte unto me and seide, "Sleepstow, man?</l>
                <l>Awake!" and gan me shake wondir faste,</l>
                <l>And with a sigh I answerde atte laste:</l>
